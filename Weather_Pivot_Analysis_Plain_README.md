# Weather Data Pivot Table & Dashboard Analysis

## Project Overview
This Excel project analyzes daily weather conditions for the year 2016, using PivotTables, PivotCharts, and interactive slicers to uncover trends and extreme events. The goal is to demonstrate professional-level Excel analytics skills, from structuring and cleaning data to building a fully functional analytical dashboard.

## Objectives
- Import and structure daily weather data.
- Build PivotTables to summarize key weather metrics.
- Create visual dashboards using PivotCharts.
- Add slicers for interactive filtering.
- Highlight extreme weather events, seasonal patterns, and condition-based averages.

## Dataset
**Source:** Historical daily weather conditions for the year 2016.

**Columns include:**
- Date
- Number of Days
- Conditions (Clear, Rain, Snow, etc.)
- Max Temp (°F)
- Mean Temp (°F)
- Min Temp (°F)
- Max Wind Speed (MPH)
- Precipitation (inches)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preparation in Excel.
- Creation of PivotTables and PivotCharts.
- Applying conditional formatting linked to PivotTable fields.
- Using Value Filters for Top/Bottom N analysis.
- Designing dashboards with interactive slicers.


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates Excel's ability to transform raw daily weather data into an interactive, visually clear, and analytically rich report. PivotTables, PivotCharts, and slicers allow users to identify seasonal patterns, extreme events, and condition-based variations quickly, making it a strong example of applied data analytics in Excel.
